## üéØ About The Project

This project was developed as part of the Microsoft Azure AI Internship with the Edunet Foundation to demonstrate the practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for enhancing career readiness.

The application leverages two distinct NLP techniques:
1.  **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Using a custom-trained spaCy model to extract specific skills (keywords) from both the resume and the job description.
2.  **Semantic Similarity**: Using Sentence Transformers to analyze the contextual meaning and relevance between the resume's experience and the job's responsibilities, going beyond simple keyword matching.

The final "Overall Match Score" is a weighted average of these two analyses, providing a more holistic view of a candidate's fit for a role.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üìÑ PDF Resume Parsing**: Upload your resume for automated text extraction.
- **üìã Job Description Input**: Paste any job description to assess compatibility.
- **üìä AI-Powered Analysis**:
  - **Overall Match Score**: A weighted score indicating your profile's alignment with the job.
  - **Keyword Match**: Percentage based on skills explicitly found in both documents.
  - **Context Match**: Semantic analysis of how well the meaning of your resume matches the job.
- **üí° Actionable Recommendations**: Get AI-driven suggestions to:
  - Weave in missing skills.
  - Rephrase experience to improve contextual alignment.
- **‚úÖ Skill Gap Analysis**: Clearly see which required skills you have and which you are missing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `pip` and `venv`
- Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jahnavikonatala21/CareerCore.git
    cd CareerCore
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download the spaCy model:**
    The application uses the `en_core_web_lg` model. Download it by running:
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
    ```

5.  **Ensure `skills.jsonl` is present:**
    This file contains the custom skill patterns for the NER model. Make sure it is in the root directory of the project.

6.  **Launch the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your browser should open with the app running at `http://localhost:8501`.
